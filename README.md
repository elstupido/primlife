# PrimLife Unreal

This repository hosts the next iteration of **PrimLife** built using Unreal Engine. The legacy Python code under `src/` remains for reference.

## Project layout

- `PrimLife.uproject` &ndash; Unreal project file
- `Source/PrimLife` &ndash; C++ module stub
- `Content/` &ndash; Assets (empty)
- `Config/` &ndash; Engine configuration (empty)

## Building

Open `PrimLife.uproject` with Unreal Engine 5 and generate project files. The C++ module contains a minimal `PrimLife` game module ready for further development.

The old Python implementation and tests are preserved in `src/` and `tests/` but are not required for the Unreal version.
